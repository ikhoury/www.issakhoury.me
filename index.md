## About me

I am a hard-working and dedicated Software Engineer with a focus on delivering high quality solutions that make the required impact.

My main interest is in the development of distributed services that help in extracting value out of business data. Very often they need to handle data at a very large scale; therefore it is critical to design software that can process, store and query data efficiently using different storage technologies.

My priority in any software project is delivering features to the customer that help him make the impacts he needs as soon as possible. I advocate for incremental delivery of value along with continuous evaluation and improvement of the product.

Therefore, I believe in cross-functional agile teams that can work together in an end to end delivery process in order to constantly push out value to the customer while maintaining a high level of software quality.
